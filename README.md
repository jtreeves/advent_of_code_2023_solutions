# Advent of Code: 2023 - Solutions

My solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) challenge problems from [2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023). Each day's solution is stored in its own folder. To run a day's solution, execute: `python3 main.py 1 True`, substituting the specific day for `1`. The final CLI argument is a boolean argument indicating whether you want to view the solutions from the practice data or the final data, where `True` is for the final data and `False` is for the practice data.
